### PA1: 
This assignment focuses on implementing a multiprocessor version of the Rate Monotonic Scheduling algorithm using POSIX threads for multithreading and stream sockets for interprocess communication.

### PA2: 
This assignment extends the previous one by implementing a distributed version of the Rate Monotonic Scheduling algorithm using sockets for interprocess communication, where a server program handles multiple client requests concurrently using forked child processes.

### PA3:
This assignment enhances the previous solutions by incorporating interprocess synchronization mechanisms using named POSIX semaphores, pthread mutex semaphores, and pthread condition variables to ensure thread safety and proper coordination in a multithreaded environment.
